<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a passionate back-end and systems engineer with 4+ years of professional experience. An easy-going person whose seriousness is reflected in code and tooling. I have a deep interest in the bridge between punching code into your favorite editor and seeing real business value derived from it.</p>

<h2 class="resume-section">Recent Accomplishments</h2>


<div class="accomplishment-headline">Played a major role in wrangling our microservice testing nightmare</div>
<p class="accomplishment">Our microservice based system had an extremely complex test suite where tests were often non-deterministic, tests were easy to write but very hard to debug, and we were often mislead by successful tests who gave us false confidence and allowed us to ship bugs frequently.</p>
<ul class="accomplishment-bullets">
<li>Refocused on testing paradigms including unit testing, component testing, and integration testing.</li><li>Automated the testing process to gain true confidence before deploying to our production environment.</li>
</ul>

<div class="accomplishment-headline">Spearheaded a major simplification of our microservice coding standards</div>
<p class="accomplishment">Previously our microservices had been built in a hand rolled, do it all, microservice framework. The framework paradoxically made services harder to write, more fragile, and less uniform due to ever-changing boiler plate generators. My focus was a back to basics, \textsc{kiss}, style of coding with an emphasis on standard libraries, fewer arbitrary imports, and reusable, single purpose, libraries for when the ecosystem did not already provide a high fidelity alternative.</p>
<ul class="accomplishment-bullets">
<li>Realigned our coding standards with more industry standard tools and techniques.</li><li>Removed around 100K lines of error prone code from our codebase.</li><li>Improved deployment speed, service startup, and service reliability.</li>
</ul>
